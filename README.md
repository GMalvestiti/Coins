# RPG Coins

*RPG Coins* is a Fabric mod that adds three new coin items — gold, iron, and copper — that can be used for trading or custom gameplay mechanics. Inspired by the RPG Series mods.

## Features

- Adds **Gold Coin**, **Iron Coin**, and **Copper Coin** items.

## Recipes

From version **3.0.0** onward, the mod **no longer includes** default coin crafting recipes. Server owners and modpack creators must provide their own.

This change improves flexibility, as adding custom recipes is **easier and more straightforward** than removing predefined ones, allowing full control over how coins are obtained.

Ways to implement custom recipes:

- [Vanilla Data Packs](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_pack)
    - Example Recipes Data Pack: [Here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/worlds/rpg-coins-recipes-datapack)
- [Crafting Tweaks](https://modrinth.com/mod/crafting-tweaks)
- [KubeJS](https://modrinth.com/mod/kubejs)
- Other recipe management tools.
